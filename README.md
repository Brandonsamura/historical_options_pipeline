## Overview

The **Historical Options Pipeline** serves as a comprehensive tool for those interested in analyzing options data. It allows users to gather data from various sources, process it, and make it accessible for further analysis. This project is built using Python and integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Efficiently gather options data from multiple APIs.
- **Data Pipeline**: Process and transform data into a usable format.
- **API Server**: Serve processed data through a RESTful API.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyze historical trends in options data.
- **Open Interest Tracking**: Monitor open interest in various options contracts.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, even for those new to quantitative finance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Historical Options Pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brandonsamura/historical_options_pipeline.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd historical_options_pipeline
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database. Make sure to create a database and user with the appropriate permissions.

## Installation

To install the Historical Options Pipeline, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brandonsamura/historical_options_pipeline.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd historical_options_pipeline
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the Historical Options Pipeline, you can start using it. The main script can be run as follows:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate the data ingestion process and set up the API server. You can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Data Ingestion

The data ingestion module is responsible for collecting options data from various sources. This module can be configured to pull data from different APIs, including but not limited to:

- **Alpha Vantage**
- **Yahoo Finance**
- **Interactive Brokers**

You can customize the ingestion settings in the `ingestion.py` file. 

### Example Configuration

```python
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
SOURCE = 'Alpha Vantage'
```

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline processes the ingested data and transforms it into a structured format suitable for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and organizing it into time-series format.

### Key Steps in the Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates and handle missing data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Convert raw data into a structured format.
3. **Time-Series Formatting**: Organize data into time-series for analysis.

## API Server

The API server provides access to the processed data. It is built using Flask and allows users to query options data through RESTful endpoints.

### Available Endpoints

- **GET /options**: Retrieve all options data.
- **GET /options/<symbol>**: Retrieve options data for a specific symbol.
- **GET /open_interest**: Retrieve open interest data.

### Example Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/options/AAPL
```
